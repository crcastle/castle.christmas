My nephew likes pushing buttons, especially buttons that turn lights on and off. "Push it," he'll often command the nearest adult.

(He's 2. But still, I completely understand his desire. If I don't know what a buttons does, it's getting pushed.)

My sister and her husband just got a Christmas tree and strung lights around it, so naturally my nephew needs a fun (and safe) way to turn the lights on and off himself.
