# High Energy, Low Power: A Bluetooth Christmas Story

## The button

My 2 year old, Castle, likes pushing buttons—especially ones that turn lights on. When a Christmas tree appeared one year, and lights were put up, he was very excited. At the same time, I was experimenting with [Puck.js](https://www.puck-js.com), a programmable low power bluetooth button, and had a brainwave—I could combine my nephew's love of buttons and of lights. A true Christmas miracle.

Armed with a Puck.js button and a bluetooth-powered power outlet, I decided to make the Christmas lights magic. I dug into the code, (sparse) documentation, and seemingly oft-ignored specifications, eventually reverse engineering the whole thing. The result was this:

## The interactive instruction manual

But that wasn't enough. I decided to build a site around it, showing how it worked—an interactive instruction manual you might say—while learning more about design, SVG animation, and the occasional perils of the tools we choose to use.

All so my nephew could press a button and see some magic happen.
